<p></p>I am Graphic Design Major that wants to show case my talents and help others with my designs and concepts. The buisness is about Branding
and all the other componets that fall into that.  We help you think of a concept and start with a logo.  We look at color schemes to match
what kind of feel you want to present.  We help with the slogan and the missionstatement so it can be professional and stand out.</p>
